# Habit App

### Notes for midway checkpoint
- HabitEvent view is complete but addHabit event was planned for the final checkpoint, therefore can only view HabitsEvents if added through firestore
  - We have tested HabitEvents added view this method and both the list and event view is working

### Test Cases
- Unit tests created for all entity classes (User, Habit, and HabitEvent)
  - Can view unit test results in github actions menu
- Intent test created for each user story in midway checkpoint

### Response to Feedback
- We recieved feedback that we should create sub tasks for our issues
  - For all new user stories and those planned for the final checkpoint (and some in the midway), we've added subtasks to each issue
- Can view in issues menu or on GitHub Project Board

### User StoryBoard, UML, and CRC cards
- View in Wiki tab

### Documentation
- We were unable to generate Javadoc but all code should have Javadoc style comments
