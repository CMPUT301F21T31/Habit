# Habit App

### Notes for midway checkpoint
- HabitEvent view is complete but addHabit event is not, therefor can only view HabitsEvents if added view database
  - This is because adding habit events was part of our finalcheckpoint, but view was in the midway

### Test Cases
- Unit tests created for all entity classes (User, Habit, and HabitEvent)
  - Can view unit test results in github actions menu
- Intent test created for each user story in midway checkpoint

### Response to Feedback
- We recieved feedback that we should create sub tasks for our issues
  - For all new user stories and those planned for the final checkpoint (and some in the midway), we've added subtasks to each issue
- Can view in issues menu or on GitHub Project Board

### User StoryBoard, UML, and CRC cards
- View in Wiki tab
